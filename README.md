This is my first project ever following the Odin Project curriculum.
The task was to replicate the design(not the functionality) of the Google Homepage,
the main task was learning how to position elements with CSS. The HTML part was prretty easy,
but I had trouble with some of the CSS styling but I guess I'll learn that with experience.
I added a .gitignore file wanting to ignore the images but I don't think I am ignoring them.

Thanks for reading, Igor
